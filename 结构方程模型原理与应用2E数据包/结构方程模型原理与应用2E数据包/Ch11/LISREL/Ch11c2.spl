Ch11 Two factor latent change model using SIMPLIS syntax
Observed Variables: RT1-RT4
Covariance matrix from file=Ch11a.cov
means from file=Ch11a.cov
Sample Size = 200
Latent Variables  Level Shape
Relationships
RT1 = 1*Level 0*Shape  
RT2 = 1*Level Shape 
RT3 = 1*Level Shape 
RT4 = 1*Level 1*Shape 
Level=CONST
Shape=CONST
Set the error variance of RT1 and RT2 and RT3 and RT4 equal
Set the covariance of Level-Shape to 0
